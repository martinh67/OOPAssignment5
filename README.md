# Parts Worker

My fifth assignment in Java:

Modify the Payroll system to include an additional Employee subclass PartsWorker that represents an employee whose pay is based on the number of
pieces of merchandise produced. For example, if the employee earns €5 for each part produced and he/she produces 20 parts then total payment is €100.
This category of employee also has a bonus incentive scheme. If the employee produces more than a certain number of pieces, then a standard bonus is
added to their total payment. Class PartsWorker should contain private variables to store payment per piece, the number of pieces produced, the fixed
bonus amount and the number of pieces required before a bonus is applied. Provide a concrete implementation of earnings in class PartsWorker that
calculates the employee's earnings appropriately. Add two other methods to the PartsWorker class that you think might be useful. Provide a separate
class to test the functionality of the PartsWorker class.
